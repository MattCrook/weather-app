### Weather App
Very simple weather app I created to practice using vanilla JS. Tells current weather based on user's current long and lat coordinates, displays temperature in C and F, displays the city the user is in, and shows weather icon (clouds, sunny, rainy etc...) based on the actual weather forecast.

### ToDos
* API fetch call currently not functional. Need proxy to handle cross-orgin requests.
* Styles need touching up.
* Based on which icon is displayed, render "mostly cloudy", "mostly sunny", etc...
